# TikTok Analysis of Kasselakis' Political Campaign

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the TikTok presence and engagement metrics of Stefanos Kasselakis during his campaign for the SYRIZA party elections. By examining TikTok data, we aim to understand the digital engagement strategies and their effectiveness in the political landscape.

## Findings

The analysis revealed insights into various engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and share counts. Key findings include:
- The distribution of engagement metrics across different videos.
- Correlation between different types of engagement.
- Temporal trends in engagement during the campaign period.

## Data Collection Process

The data was collected using TikTok API endpoints, with responses processed and saved into structured CSV files. The key steps involved:
1. Setting up a Playwright script to automate the data collection.
2. Extracting relevant data points such as video URLs, creation times, and engagement statistics.
3. Saving the collected data into CSV files for further analysis.


## Data Analysis Process

The data analysis involved several steps:
1. **Filtering and Cleaning**: Filtering videos related to Kasselakis and cleaning the data for analysis.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating basic statistics of engagement metrics.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing the correlation between different engagement metrics.
4. **Visualization**: Creating histograms to visualize the distribution of engagement metrics and temporal trends.


## Skills and Approaches

During this project, I enhanced my skills in:
- Data collection using web scraping and API interactions.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in Python.
- Conducting statistical analysis and visualizing data using libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Automating repetitive tasks using Playwright.

## Future Work

While the current analysis provides valuable insights, there are areas for future improvement:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Conducting sentiment analysis on the comments to gauge public opinion.
- **Extended Data Collection**: Collecting data over a more extended period to analyze long-term trends.
- **Comparison with Other Candidates**: Comparing Kasselakis' engagement metrics with other candidates to understand relative performance.

With more time, these additional analyses could provide deeper insights into the digital strategies of political campaigns.
